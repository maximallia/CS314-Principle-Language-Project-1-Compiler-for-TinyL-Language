# Principle-Language-Project-1-Compiler-for-TinyL-Language

Summary:

In this project, you will be asked to write a recursive descent LL(1) parser and code generator for the tinyL language. Your compiler will generate RISC machine instructions. You will also write a code optimizer that takes RISC machine instructions as input and removes redundant code. The output of the optimizer is a sequence of RISC machine instructions which produces the same results as the original input sequence but is more efficient. To test your generated programs, you will use a provided virtual machine that can “run” your RISC code. The project will require you to manipulate doubly-linked lists of instructions. In order to avoid memory leaks, explicit deallocation of unused memory space is necessary.
